# Awesome TinyGo

## Continuous Integration

* [TinyHCI](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinyhci) - Test actual hardware connections for microcontrollers. It is intended to provide smoke test implementations that exercise the basic functionality for each kind of hardware interface for each supported microcontroller.
## Display Hardware

* [TinyST7735](https://github.com/Nerzal/tinyst7735) - Driver for ST7735 TFT Display for the Arduino UNO
* [TinyDraw](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinydraw) - Draw primitives on TinyGo displays. It is heavily based on the Adafruit GFX library.
* [TinyFont](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinyfont) - Font/text package for TinyGo displays. It is heavily based on Adafruit's GFX library.
* [TinyTerm](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinyterm) - A minimal terminal for TinyGo devices supporting 256-color ANSI escape codes.


## Embedded Systems

* [TinyGo Drivers](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers) - Provides a collection of hardware drivers for devices such as sensors and displays that can be used together with TinyGo.

## WebAssembly
### DOM Manipulation

* [TinyDom](https://github.com/Nerzal/tinydom) - DOM manipulation library. For use in WASM

### WebSockets

* [TinyWebSocket](https://github.com/Nerzal/tinywebsocket) - Wraps the `syscall/js` api to provide a better developer experience, while being compileable by TinyGo
## Wireless Communication

* [Go Bluetooth](https://github.com/tinygo-org/bluetooth) - Go Bluetooth is a cross-platform package for using Bluetooth Low Energy hardware from the Go programming language.


# Awesome TinyGo Creations
**Hardware and software implementations**
## LED controllers

* [LED Cube](https://github.com/tinygo-org/things/tree/master/ledcube) - 6x32x32 LED cube, inspired by a LED cube I've seen at CCC and the SquareWave Dot cube.
